Notes regarding the 485 class issues:

	- It's counted as an elective, we may be able to make an appeal on the grounds of pushing for this to accept this towards my graduation requirements. (Graduation Petition)
	- Possible alternative is to do self-directed studies (css 490) for possible credit/no-credit to cover the 5-credits of electives.
